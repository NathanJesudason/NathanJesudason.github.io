<h2>History Class Chrome Extension</h2>
<img src="images/Mine.jpg" alt="Trump Says China Chrome Extension Promotion">
<p>I made this chrome extension in one hour because my history teacher 
kept pulling up videos of Trump saying China (we were learning about Mao).
After making it I sent it to him, and he then demonstrated it in class.<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trump-says-china/ccnkhmdohfdgpigempafolbddmliplbf">Now it has
a five star rating and over 70 downloads.</a></p>

<h2>Box Step Robot</h2>
<video controls>

</video>
<p> This was a small arduino robot that I worked on along with Dexter Carpenter. The main challenge with the robot was trying to get the robot to turn
around a box and go indefinitely. There is no gyro, encoders, or step motors involved, so the robot takes a roughly right angle blind, and then is
supposed to adjust as it detects the box. The result is somewhat successful.</p>

<h2>Bear Game</h2>
<img src="images/PacBear.JPG" alt="image of Bear Game">
<p>This was the first major attempt at creating a video game with Unity. This was done in the second year of
my game making class, after working with Gamemaker and 2d games. The results were a lot of sheep and a humanoid bear.</p>
