<p>Not really, its just some random projects I have worked on.</p>

<h2>Trump Says China Chrome Extension</h2>
<img src="images/Mine.jpg" alt="Trump Says China Chrome Extension Promotion">
<p>I made this chrome extension in one hour because my history teacher 
kept pulling up videos of Trump saying China (we were learning about Mao).
After making it I sent it to him, and he then demonstrated it in class. Now it has
a five star rating and over 70 downloads.</p>
