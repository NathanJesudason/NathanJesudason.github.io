<h2><a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019">GMTK Game Jam 2019</a> Entry: <a href="https://nathanjesudason.itch.io/one-item-quest">One Item Quest</a></h2>

<p>Unfortunately I didn't have the full 48 hours to develop One Item Quest, but I am still pleased with the work I created.
The most impressive code to me was the inventory system, which could add custom item scriptable objects. If I had more time to develop the game I would've
    added a leveling system for each item, as that would allow the player more experimentation with the mechanics of only using one item at a time.</p>

<img src="images/puzzl3.jpg" alt="Puzzl3 game">
<p>I am most proud of the shadow clone system in Puzzl3. The main way it works is by deep copying a list of position vectors of the player,
    and then looping through them. The main improvement upon this would've been to ensure that the vectors were recorded and played back at the same rate, because sometimes that doesn't happen and it causes odd issues.
	In terms of game design, I definitely think the player needed some basic animation, well
    as having background music in the game.</p>

<h2><a href= "https://itch.io/jam/ssjarcade"> Summer Slow Jams June 2019: Arcade Games</a> Entry: <a href="https://nathanjesudason.itch.io/tentacles">Tentacles</a></h2>
<img src="images/Tentacles.png" alt="Tentacles">
<p>After a two year haitus on game development, I was the sole programmer on a team of 4 for a two week long game jam. The result was Tentacles. 
From developing this game I got reacquainted with many features of Unity. I learned about animations and the infinite state machine that Unity uses for
    them. I learned about the 2D physics engine of Unity, and I first started using the particle system in Unity.</p>

<h2>History Class Chrome Extension</h2>
<img src="images/Mine.jpg" alt="Trump Says China Chrome Extension Promotion">
<p>I made this chrome extension in one hour because my history teacher 
kept pulling up videos of Trump saying China (we were learning about Mao).
After making it I sent it to him, and he then demonstrated it in class.<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trump-says-china/ccnkhmdohfdgpigempafolbddmliplbf">Now it has
a five star rating and almost 150 downloads.</a></p>

<h2>Box Step Robot</h2>

</video>
<p> This was a small arduino robot that I worked on along with <a href='https://github.com/DexterCarpenter'>Dexter Carpenter</a>. The main challenge with the robot was trying to get the robot to turn
around a box and go indefinitely. There is no gyro, encoders, or step motors involved, so the robot takes a roughly right angle blind, and then is
supposed to adjust as it detects the box. The result is somewhat successful.</p>

<h2>Bear Game</h2>
<img src="images/PacBear.JPG" alt="image of Bear Game">
<p>This was the first major attempt at creating a video game with Unity. This was done in the second year of
my game making class, after working with Gamemaker and 2d games. The results were a lot of sheep and a humanoid bear.</p>
