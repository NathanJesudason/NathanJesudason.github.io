<h2>Trump Says China Chrome Extension</h2>
<p>I made this chrome extension in one hour because my history teacher 
kept pulling up videos of Trump saying China (we were learning about Mao).
After making it I sent it to him, and he then demonstrated it in class. Now it has
a five star rating and over 70 downloads.</p>
