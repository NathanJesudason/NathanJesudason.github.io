    <p> A quick JS discord bot, this one uses the Discord api to read each new message in a channel it's on, and either set the nickname of the user to that message
        or reply with the standard "Hi (blank), I'm dad" if appropriate. Do not worry, I added in a few commands to prevent the bot from becoming too annoying if needed. The code for the bot
        is available <a href="https://github.com/NathanJesudason/discord_dad_joke_bot"> here</a>.

    <p>This calendar application is made with HTML/CSS/JS. It has a microservice integration for a weather service from another team member in my software
        engineering class, so that it gets the location of the user and returns the weather for the week.
        Features include creating, editting, deleting, and copy-pasting events. The code is provided <a href="https://github.com/NathanJesudason/cs361_calendar_app"> here</a>.

    <p>For my web development class we had to implment the JS for creating a post from user inputs and filtering that content. Shown here is inputting a post
        for a cat and it being added to a list of posts, and then filtering those posts to get that post of a cat. Because it is a class project,
        I cannot share the code publicly.</p>

        The user can decide the size of the cave and whether or not they can see the cave that is randomly generated. The code cannot be shared publicly because
        it was for a class assignment.</p>

    <img src="images/1itemquest.jpg" alt="One Item Quest Screenshot">
    <p>Unfortunately I didn't have the full 48 hours to develop One Item Quest, but I am still pleased with the work I created.
    The most impressive code to me was the inventory system, which could add custom item scriptable objects. If I had more time to develop the game I would've
        added a leveling system for each item, as that would allow the player more experimentation with the mechanics of only using one item at a time.</p>

    <div class = "project_content">
    <img src="images/puzzl3.jpg" alt="Puzzl3 game">
    <p>I am most proud of the shadow clone system in Puzzl3. The main way it works is by deep copying a list of position vectors of the player,
        and then looping through them. The main improvement upon this would've been to ensure that the vectors were recorded and played back at the same rate, because sometimes that doesn't happen and it causes odd issues.
        In terms of game design, I definitely think the player needed some basic animation, well
        as having background music in the game.</p>

    <p>After a two year haitus on game development, I was the sole programmer on a team of 4 for a two week long game jam. The result was Tentacles. 
    From developing this game I got reacquainted with many features of Unity. I learned about animations and the infinite state machine that Unity uses for
        them. I learned about the 2D physics engine of Unity, and I first started using the particle system in Unity.</p>
